Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player controls a laser cannon
by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to
defeat five rows of eleven aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance
toward the bottom of the screen. The playerâ€™s laser cannon is partially protected by several stationary
defense bunkers that are gradually destroyed from the top and bottom by blasts from either the aliens or
the player. The player defeats an alien and earns points by shooting it with the laser cannon. There are
various levels of the game
